A web-based iPhone app for glitching jpeg images.

---

This app was created as part of a brief on my course [Graphic Arts & Design @ Leeds Metropolitan University]
called "Fruit Machine".

The project was in response to three pieces of information I was given:

 * An IMAGE of random HEXIDECIMAL VALUES [Content]
 * The word CAMERA PHONE [Constraints]
 * The word NAIVE ART [Confusion]

The images are either going to be collaborated into a zine or exhibited at an exhibition. I haven't decided yet.

---

The app uses Picup [http://picupapp.com] to upload the images from Mobile Safari.
It also uses Recyclism's Corrupt [https://github.com/recyclism/Corrupt] software to glitch the images.

Credits to:
 * Benjamin Gaulon---For use of his Corrupt software.
 * Ali Qureshi---For his article on how to use Picup.
 * Everyone who has taken photos for me (full list coming soon).

KNOWN BUGS
======

* New window doesn't open in some (maybe older?) versions of iOS, so clicking "RE-BEND" closes the session without restoring another one. [Thanks Alex Reekie]
* Re-uploading the same photo twice yields strange results. [Thanks Lydia Caprani]
